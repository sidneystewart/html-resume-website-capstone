    <h2>My interests outside of work!</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Reading</li></h3>
            <p>As of 2/4/2024 I have completed four books out of the 24 books I've challenged myself to read this year. I will conquer my GoodReads challenge this year! My most recent read:</p>

        <h3><li>Music</li></h3>
            <p>I have always had an affinity for music, and love to explore new genres and artists regularly. I'm currently working on a playlist where each week I save my favorite song from that week's Spotify-generated Discovery Weekly playlist. I can't wait to get to the end of the year and see the tapestry of sounds that it will contain. My saved song for this week:</p>

        <h3><li>Knitting</li></h3>
            <p>I've known how to knit (the very basics) since I was a child, but recently I've been intrigued by the practicality of knitting. Being a sweater girlie, my goal is to knit myself a fully functional and aesthetic sweater (and maybe a pair of socks). The sweater pattern I have my eye on:</p>

        <h3><li>Exercising</li></h3>
            <p>I try to workout at least 3 times a week. I love tracking my runs and gradually seeing my PR times improve. My goal is to run a 5k without stopping. Last month my fastest mile time was: </p>
